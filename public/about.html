<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Robyn</p>

<p>In 2024 I decided to take the plunge and chance careers, moving into the exciting world of Tech. I wanted to challenge 
  myself to learn and master something new and exiting!</p>

<p>I started my journey by diving into a Software engineering bootcamp. Focussing mainly on
  Python, Git and Github. I loved the course but I knew there was so much more 
  to learn so embarked on a filling in my knowledge gaps. Starting with Web development basics like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
